There are multiple ways of using resources from modules, but the simplest one is to use the built-in components from `BlazorLazyLoading.Components`.

It should be installed in every library that wants to consume decoupled resources:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="BlazorLazyLoading.Components" Version="1.1.0" />
```

This section will cover the different components available and their usage.
